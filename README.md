# Cloud engineering
Cloud Service providers like AWS, GCP, Azure, among others play a vital role in an organisation. I am a subject matter expert in AWS and GCP using major components of both service providers for 7+ years.

# IAC Terrafrom,Ansible etc
I have a good understanding of Infrastructure as Code from using tools like Terraform , Puppet, Chef, Ansible in my day to day tasks. I also automate configuration and setup scodified with Configuration Management tools ie ansible & chef.

# Container Orchestration
I have a good understanding and knowledge of container orchestration tools like Kubernetes ,Docker swarm, podman, & Docker Engine. Many modern organizations are migrating away from the traditional deployment models of apps being pushed to VMs, and over to a containerized system landscape.

# Collaboration and communication
DevOps is all about breaking down barriers between IT operations and development. In this modern DevOps age, we no longer have developers throwing code “over the wall” to operations. I am comfortable in an agile environment having used jira,monday.com and slack to communicate and track projects

# CICD
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment can be said as the two best practices that have gained a lot of traction these days. I am experienced with tools like Jenkins, Circle CI, argo cd, Semaphore CI, Github actions,bitbucket pipelines , teckton pipelines , etc.

# Kubernetes Guru
I have eperience managing large kubernetes clusters on GKE and EKS , i am also well versed with kubenetes deployments using k8s manifests files , terraform providers and helm charts.

# Observability
As a devops engineer i have implemented monitoring, logging and alerting solutions to help unveil critical insights into an application’s inner workings and make debugging custom code much easier. I have used Prometheus & grafana, newrelic , honeycomb, solarwinds etc

# Automation
I have experience and expertise with scripting languages such as bash, GNU utilities, Python, JavaScript and Go. I am familiar with cron, AWS Lambda ,CloudWatch Events, SNS and others. i have 12+ years experience on linux
